highdim
==========

A Matlab library for statistical testing with high-dimensional data, including
one and two-sample tests for homogeneity, uniformity, sphericity and
independence. Of note are implementations of a number of modern methods 
appropriate for dealing with data where dimensionality is large, possibly
exceeding the number of samples.

## Multivariate (In)dependence

## Multivariate Homogeneity

## Sphericity

## Uniformity on hypersphere
